 # AD4GD

AD4GDâ€™s mission is to co-create and shape the European Green Deal Data Space as an open hub for FAIR data and standards-based services that support the key priorities of pollution, biodiversity and climate change. The focus will be on interoperability concepts that bridge the semantic and technology gaps which currently prevent stakeholders and application domains from multi-disciplinary and multi-scale access to data, and which impede the exploitation of processing services, and processing platforms at different levels including Cloud, HPC and edge computing.
This project will enable the combination and integration of data from remote sensing, established Virtual Research Environments and Research Infrastructures, Internet of Things (IoT), socio-economic data, INSPIRE and Citizen Science (CitSci) in an interoperable, scalable and reliable manner. This will facilitate integration by including semantic mappings to different standards and dominant models bridging domain- and data source-specific semantic concepts such as the Essential Variables framework, as well as applying machine learning and geospatial user feedback to ensure quality, reliability and trustworthiness of data and transforming spatial scales.

The AD4GD project aims to:

- Co-design a Green Deal common Data Space of interoperable building blocks for heterogeneous data integration, artificial intelligence, Web APIs etc. allowing multiple existing data models and API standards to be fully integrated by semantic mapping.
- Ensure the FAIR integration of CitSci with other in-situ Earth observation data and INSPIRE data in the European Green Deal Data Space.
- Enable heterogeneous IoT communication protocols and data format integration into a common semantic model for the climate-related, geospatial an environmental European GD Data Space.
- Overcome data fragmentation by combining Earth Observation data from satellites with other sources of data into a common climate-related, geospatial and environmental data space to support the European GD Data Space.
- Enhance certainty, quality, and exploitability of heterogeneous data by leveraging on data analytics, machine learning, and Artificial Intelligence.
- Demonstrate through multi-scale, multi-criteria and multi-actor pilots the applicability and added value of data fusion for improved accessibility and decision making in the European Green Deal Data Space domains climate change, zero pollution and biodiversity.
- Research and demonstrate the potential of the AD4GD data space concept from the core to the edge to increase the scalability, performance, and convergence of use of high-performance computing, cloud, data, and artificial intelligence resources for Earth system modelling.
- Upscale and sustain the AD4GD concept and a collaborative community to support a highly scalable, comprehensive, and FAIR Green Deal European Data Space for citizens, researchers, policy, and decision makers.
